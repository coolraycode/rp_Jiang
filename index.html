                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">Overall, many studies have been completed, primarily focused on promoting overall plant growth, as it would pave the way for further scientific and commercial applications.
                        Previous studies have also addressed the addition of vitamin C and its effects on plant growth.
                        However, little has yet been studied regarding the role vitamin C plays in regulating various types of plant tropisms, specifically phototropism.

                    <h1 class="ovPadRight">Rationale</h1> 
                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadRight">A study that addresses these questions could yield lots of potential for future research and commercial application.
                        The supplement of vitamins to plants, specifically vitamin C, would allow plants to be grown under much more efficient lighting conditions.
                        This would allow for the conservation of both expenses and time.
                        Therefore, the presented study addresses this unanswered field of botany, where studies and data are lacking.
                        The study examined the success and rate at which garden cress undergoes phototropism after receiving varying quantities of supplements of vitamin C.</p>

                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">Vitamin C has been known to play a major role in controlling and regulating a variety of processes throughout plants, including growth and producing the auxins responsible for phototropism.
                        It was hypothesized that the supplement of vitamin C (250 mg and 500 mg) to garden cress would have a substantial positive influence on garden cress’ success and speed at which it undergoes phototropism.
                        The success of phototropism between the groups was determined by comparing the average total change in angle of all the garden cress plant cups in each group.
                        The rate of phototropism between the groups was determined by comparing the average of the average change in angle in each time interval of all the plant cups in each group.
                        The independent variable of this study was the amount of vitamin C supplemented to the garden cress.
                        The dependent variable of this study was the angle (in degrees) of the tip of the stem of garden cress in relation to its base. This prediction was not supported by the data of this study. Instead, the data showed that vitamin C caused a considerable negative influence on the success and speed of phototropism in garden cress. These results may indicate that an excessive amount of vitamin C (250 mg and above) will be detrimental to a plant’s ability to undergo phototropism.
